# 3D Mandelbrot Set

Rough calculation for the visualization of the Mandelbrot set which follows the equation:

$$Z_{n+1} = {Z_{n}}^2 + c ,$$

where the position of c is only plotted in the space when the value of Z converges.

The real values of Z are plotted on the z-axis and it can be seen that along the real axis, the logistic map bifurcation is formed.
